# Frostbite
A malware that I made using C++, with SDL2 and Windows.h

This malware will **make Windows unbootable**, I suggest not running it on your computer, but instead on a virtual machine.

# Actions that Frostbite does
While it is running, **it will not allow Command Prompt or Task Manager from running (results in a bluescreen and MBR overwrite)**, it will **create disorienting effects**, **overwrite the  MBR (make Windows no longer bootable)**, and create lots of text files.

# Safe Mode
Safe Mode will not overwrite the MBR, that's pretty much it.
